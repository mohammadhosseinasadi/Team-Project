                Historians believe that the game's ancient origin lay in 12th century northern <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/">France</a> France, where a ball was struck with the palm of the hand. <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_X_of_France">Louis X of France</a>  was a keen player of <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeu_de_paume">jeu de paume</a></i>  ("game of the palm"), which evolved into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_tennis">real tennis</a> , and became notable as the first person to construct indoor tennis courts in the modern style. Louis was unhappy with playing tennis outdoors and accordingly had indoor, enclosed courts made in Paris "around the end of the 13th century". <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis#cite_note-Newman-3">[3]</a></sup>  In due course this design spread across royal palaces all over Europe. <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis#cite_note-Newman-3">[3]</a></sup>  In June 1316 at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincennes">Vincennes</a> , Val-de-Marne, and following a particularly exhausting game, Louis drank a large quantity of cooled wine and subsequently died of either <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia">pneumonia</a>  or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleurisy">pleurisy</a> , although there was also suspicion of poisoning. <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis#cite_note-Gillmeister-4">[4]</a></sup>  Because of the contemporary accounts of his death, Louis X is history's first tennis player known by name. <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis#cite_note-Gillmeister-4">[4]</a></sup>  Another of the early enthusiasts of the game was King <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_V_of_France">Charles V of France</a> , who had a court set up at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louvre_Palace">Louvre Palace.</a> <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup>

                It was not until the 16th century that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_racket">rackets</a>  came into use and the game began to be called "tennis", from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language">French</a>  term tenez, which can be translated as "hold!", "receive!" or "take!", an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interjection">interjection</a>  used as a call from the server to his opponent. <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup>  It was popular in England and France, although the game was only played indoors, where the ball could be hit off the wall. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_VIII_of_England">Henry VIII of England</a>  was a big fan of this game, which is now known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_tennis">real tennis.</a> <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup>

                <p>
                    Tennis is played on a rectangular, flat surface. The court is 78 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot_(length)">feet</a>  (23.77 m) long, and 27 feet (8.2 m) wide for singles matches and 36 ft (11 m) for doubles matches. <sup><a href="">[48]</a></sup> Additional clear space around the court is required in order for players to reach overrun balls. A net is stretched across the full width of the court, parallel with the baselines, dividing it into two equal ends. It is held up by either a cord or metal cable of diameter no greater than 0.8 cm (1⁄3 in). <sup><a href="">[49]</a></sup> The net is 3 feet 6 inches (1.07 m) high at the posts and 3 feet (0.91 m) high in the centre. <sup><a href="">[48]</a></sup> The net posts are 3 feet (0.91 m) outside the doubles court on each side or, for a singles net, 3 feet (0.91 m) outside the singles court on each side.
                    <br>
                    The modern tennis court owes its design to Major <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Clopton_Wingfield">Walter Clopton Wingfield</a> . In 1873, Wingfield patented a court much the same as the current one for his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stick%C3%A9">stické tennis</a>  (sphairistike). This template was modified in 1875 to the court design that exists today, with markings similar to Wingfield's version, but with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hourglass"> hourglass</a> shape of his court changed to a rectangle. <sup><a href="">[50]</a></sup>

                    Tennis is unusual in that it is played on a variety of surfaces. <sup><a href="">[51]</a></sup> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass_court"> Grass</a>, clay, and hard courts of concrete or asphalt topped with acrylic are the most common. Occasionally carpet is used for indoor play, with hardwood flooring having been historically used. Artificial turf courts can also be found.

                <p>
                    The lines that delineate the width of the court are called the baseline (farthest back) and the service line (middle of the court). The short mark in the centre of each baseline is referred to as either the hash mark or the centre mark. The outermost lines that make up the length are called the doubles sidelines; they are the boundaries for doubles matches. The lines to the inside of the doubles sidelines are the singles sidelines, and are the boundaries in singles play. The area between a doubles sideline and the nearest singles sideline is called the doubles alley, playable in doubles play. The line that runs across the centre of a player's side of the court is called the service line because the serve must be delivered into the area between the service line and the net on the receiving side. Despite its name, this is not where a player legally stands when making a serve. <sup><a href="#">[52]</a></sup>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The line dividing the service line in two is called the centre line or centre service line. The boxes this centre line creates are called the service boxes; depending on a player's position, they have to hit the ball into one of these when serving. <sup><a href="#">[53]</a></sup> A ball is out only if none of it has hit the area inside the lines, or the line, upon its first bounce. All lines are required to be between 1 and 2 inches (25 and 51 mm) in width, with the exception of the baseline which can be up to 4 inches (100 mm) wide, although in practice it is often the same width as the others. <sup><a href="#">[52]</a></sup>

            <p>
                In most professional play and some amateur competition, there is an officiating head judge or chair <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referee"> umpire</a> (usually referred to simply as the umpire), who sits in a raised chair to one side of the court. The umpire has absolute authority to make factual determinations. The umpire may be assisted by line judges, who determine whether the ball has landed within the required part of the court and who also call foot faults. There also may be a net judge who determines whether the ball has touched the net during service. The umpire has the right to overrule a line judge or a net judge if the umpire is sure that a clear mistake has been made. <sup><a href="#">[61]</a></sup>
                <br><br>
                In past tournaments, line judges tasked with calling the serve were sometimes assisted by electronic sensors that beeped to indicate an out-of-bounds serve; one such system was called "Cyclops". <sup><a href="#">[62]</a></sup> Cyclops has since largely been replaced by the Hawk-Eye system. <sup><a href="#">[63][64]</a></sup> In professional tournaments using this system, players are allowed three unsuccessful appeals per set, plus one additional appeal in the tiebreak to challenge close line calls by means of an electronic review. The US Open, Miami Masters, US Open Series, and World Team Tennis started using this challenge system in 2006 and the Australian Open and Wimbledon introduced the system in 2007. <sup><a href="#">[65]</a></sup> In clay-court matches, such as at the French Open, a call may be questioned by reference to the mark left by the ball's impact on the court surface.
                <br><br>
                The referee, who is usually located off the court, is the final authority about tennis rules. When called to the court by a player or team captain, the referee may overrule the umpire's decision if the tennis rules were violated (question of law) but may not change the umpire's decision on a question of fact. If, however, the referee is on the court during play, the referee may overrule the umpire's decision. (This would only happen in Davis Cup or Fed Cup matches, not at the World Group level, when a chair umpire from a non-neutral country is in the chair). <sup><a href="#">[61]</a></sup>
                <br><br>
                Ball boys and girls may be employed to retrieve balls, pass them to the players, and hand players their towels. They have no adjudicative role. In rare events (e.g., if they are hurt or if they have caused a hindrance), the umpire may ask them for a statement of what actually happened. The umpire may consider their statements when making a decision. In some leagues, especially junior leagues, players make their own calls, trusting each other to be honest. This is the case for many school and university level matches. The referee or referee's assistant, however, can be called on court at a player's request, and the referee or assistant may change a player's call. In unofficiated matches, a ball is out only if the player entitled to make the call is sure that the ball is out.

                    In tennis, a junior is a player under 18 who is still legally protected by a parent or guardian. Players on the main adult tour who are under 18 must have documents signed by a parent or guardian. These players, however, are still eligible to play in junior tournaments.
                    <br><br>
                    The International Tennis Federation (ITF) conducts a junior tour that allows juniors to establish a world ranking and 
                    an Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) or Women's Tennis Association (WTA) ranking. Most juniors who enter the international circuit do so by progressing through ITF, Satellite, Future, and Challenger tournaments before entering the main circuit. The latter three circuits also have adults competing in them. Some juniors, however, such as Australian Lleyton Hewitt and Frenchman Gaël Monfils, have catapulted directly from the junior tour to the ATP tour by dominating the junior scene or by taking advantage of opportunities given to them to participate in professional tournaments.
                    <br><br>
                    In 2004, the ITF implemented a new rankings scheme to encourage greater participation in doubles, by combining two rankings (singles and doubles) into one combined tally. <sup><a href="#">[66]</a></sup> Junior tournaments do not offer prize money except for the Grand Slam tournaments, which are the most prestigious junior events. Juniors may earn income from tennis by participating in the Future, Satellite, or Challenger tours. Tournaments are broken up into different tiers offering different amounts of ranking points, culminating with Grade A.Leading juniors are allowed to participate for their nation in the Junior Fed Cup and Davis Cup competitions. To succeed in tennis often means having to begin playing at a young age. To facilitate and nurture a junior's growth in tennis, almost all tennis playing nations have developed a junior development system. Juniors develop their play through a range of tournaments on all surfaces, accommodating all different standards of play. Talented juniors may also receive sponsorships from governing bodies or private institutions.

                <p>
                    For right-handed players, the backhand is a stroke that begins on the left side of their body, continues across their body as contact is made with the ball, and ends on the right side of their body. It can be executed with either one hand or with both and is generally considered more difficult to master than the forehand. For most of the 20th century, the backhand was performed with one hand, using either an eastern or a continental grip. The first notable players to use two hands were the 1930s Australians <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivian_McGrath"> Vivian McGrath</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bromwich"> John Bromwich</a>, but they were lonely exceptions. The two-handed grip gained popularity in the 1970s as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bj%C3%B6rn_Borg">Björn Borg</a> , <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Evert">Chris Evert</a> , <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Connors">Jimmy Connors</a> , and later <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mats_Wilander">Mats Wilander</a>  and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marat_Safin">Marat Safin</a>  used it to great effect, and it is now used by a large number of the world's best players, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic">Novak Djokovic</a> , <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal">Rafael Nadal</a>  and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serena_Williams">Serena Williams.</a>  <sup><a href="">[82]</a></sup>
                    <br><br>
                    Two hands give the player more control, while one hand can generate a slice shot, applying backspin on the ball to produce a low trajectory bounce. Reach is also limited with the two-handed shot. The player long considered to have had the best backhand of all time, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Budge">Don Budge</a> , had a powerful one-handed stroke in the 1930s and 1940s that imparted topspin onto the ball. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Rosewall">Ken Rosewall</a> , another player noted for his one-handed backhand, used a very accurate slice backhand through the 1950s and 1960s. A small number of players, notably <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monica_Seles">Monica Seles</a> , use two hands on both the backhand and forehand sides.

Common tournament configurations include men's singles, women's singles, and doubles, where two players play on each side of the net. Tournaments may be organized for specific age groups, with upper age limits for youth and lower age limits for senior players. Example of this include the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunlop_Orange_Bowl">Orange Bowl</a>  and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Petits_As">Les Petits As</a>  junior tournaments.
